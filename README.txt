****** Steps to reproduce the results ******

1: Datasets folder contains training and testing datasets. 
   
2: "Features set" folder comprises feature set of each descriptor.

3: The code of machine learning classifiers i.e. ERT and SVM are provided in ML classifier.py file. 

4: All python codes are implemented in python version 3.6.3 using Keras package with Tensorflow backend.


NOTE: To run the codes of python, the above noted version are required to install in the systems.
